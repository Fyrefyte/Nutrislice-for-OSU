# Nutrislice-for-OSU
A server database that scrapes the dining locations across Ohio State campus. Filtering by keywords such as "high protein" or "low calorie" brings up items with the corresponding values. Made for the 2025 Hack OHI/O hackathon.

Current keywords:
- high protein
- low calorie
- low sugar

Future keywords:
- high fiber
- low fat
- low carbs
- exclude "name"
- from "location"
- specified ranges (i.e. 10g-20g protein)
